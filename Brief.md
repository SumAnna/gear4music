# Brief

The year is 2015, and Gear4music is growing into Europe.

The InventoryInterface and ProductIndexer need to be updated to support multiple languages, currencies, and per-country-visibility rules.

Your task is to create a proof of concept about how this can be done. You've been given 30 - 45 minutes to put something together.

Feel free to showcase your best practice knowledge if you wish (in a way that you might not normally do in a proof of concept).

You'll likely need to reorganise the PHP files to keep things neat now that we're adding complexity. Go for it!


(Part 2, if you have time and can handle more)

The year is 2022, and Gear4music wants to offer digital products, and products on varying condition (e.g. new, used, refurbished).

How would you extend your proof of concept to support this?
